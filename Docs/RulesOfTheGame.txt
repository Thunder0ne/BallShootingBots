1) Balls collide one another, but after any collision they do not cause any score, only direct hits cause score
2) There are 5 balls, on game start one in the centre of the map and 2 for each team to be collected and used
3) game is 5 vs 5
4) any time an agent is hit the agents gets 1 wound. Each agent has 2 wounds (TBD)
5) game is won by the last standing team
6) the arena has boundaries, so the balls and the agents collide against the arena bounds, remember back bouncing balls
do not count as hit
7) to catch a moving ball an agent has to roll a die, the probability of success depends on the speed of the ball (relative speed?)
- the probability is 1 from speed 0 to the first threshold (TBD) then goes linearly to 0 up to another threshold TBD
8) if an agent fails to catch a ball (that has not bounced against anything) the agent suffer one wound
9) the balls do _not_ move at constant speed, they lose speed in time with a predefined energy drag
